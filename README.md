# Green_The_Game
Scripts for my first video game bulit using the Unity game engine. 

The game is a 3D procedural dodge 'em up.

Coming to the Android app store soon!

Key Features:

1. Complete scoring system - high score is stored and can be reset.
2. Procedural implementation - the game is infinite!
3. Obstacle speed is proportional to time alive and there is an element of randomness vis a vis location of obstacle spawning.
4. Physics powered by the Unity physics engine!
5. Simplistic yet endearing art style!
6. Mellow tunes from: https://www.bensound.com
7. Google Play Services integration.

Tasks remining:
1. Online leaderboard
2. UI
3. Form factor + obstacle spawning 
3. More build testing
