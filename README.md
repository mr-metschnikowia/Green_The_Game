# Green_The_Game
Scripts for my first video game bulit using the Unity game engine. 

The game is a 3D procedural dodge 'em up.

Coming soon on the Android app store!

Key Features:

1. Complete scoring system - high score is stored and can be reset - leaderboards in development.
2. Procedural implementation - the game is infinite!
3. Obstacle speed is proportional to time and there is an element of randomness vis a vis location of obstacle spawning.
4. Physics powered by the Unity physics engine!
5. Simplistic yet endearing art style!
